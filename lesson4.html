    <h1> Comments </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>As you know I had trouble loading my icons. Once I correctly made the {position: point} in myMarkerOptions, it was able to find the icons. </li> 
      <li>I took the mean center of the fictional ice cream sites using ArcMap Spatial Analyst to center the map on {lat: 40.673624, lng: -78.16673}. I found the map was initially a bit off center when looking at all four sites.</li>
      <li>Tracing the vertices of the icon in MS Paint was a very interesting exercise that I never even thought Google or any other web mapping technology had the ability to do. I could see that coming in handy and being very necessary if you were using large concave icons. You can tell my icon is traced by trying to click the bottom of the ice cream cone. It's difficult.</li>
      <li>The map control options are carried over from the beginning of the lesson. I had no idea you could style a Google map as much as you could. The Styled Maps Wizard if fantastic. It all reminds me of Mapbox styling. There may be a bit more styles you can customize in MapBox, but I believe Google maps has the most recognizable map and controls. In my opinion, it's the easiest basemap for the general public to use. The decision on which platform to use when making a web map should depend on your audience. Knowing the features/tools/widgets the web map needs are also essential. It all goes along with the real purpose  of the web map in the first place.</li>
      <li>That being said, I'd like to learn as much as possible about the features of Google and ESRI API. It will also be important to have an idea of the features that leaflet, MapBox, CartoDB, OpenLayers and others have as well.</li>
