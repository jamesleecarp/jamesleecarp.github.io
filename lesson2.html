		<h2>Census Bureau to Survey Nation’s Spending Habits </h2>
			<p>Atlanta - In July, U.S. Census Bureau field representatives will collect information about how much Americans spend for groceries, clothing, housing, health care and other items from a sample of households across the country.
			</p>
			<p>
			The Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) program consists of two parts:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <em>Interview</em> Survey - About 7,000 households will be interviewed once every three months to obtain data on relatively large expenditures and also for those expenditures that occur on a regular basis (such as rent and utilities).
				</li>
				<li>The <em>Diary</em> Survey - During the year, another 7,500 households will keep two consecutive one-week diaries of all purchases - including small, frequently purchased items that are normally difficult for respondents to recall later (such as a fast-food purchase at a drive-through window; a soda or candy bar from a vending machine, or a carton of eggs from the supermarket).
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics then publishes integrated data from the two surveys — providing a snapshot of our nation's economy and spending habits. Government economists use the survey results to update a "market basket" of goods and services for the Consumer Price Index, our nation's most widely used measure of inflation.
			</p>
			<p>
			"Findings from this survey help business and community leaders make sound decisions,” said George Grandy Jr., director of the Census Bureau’s Atlanta Regional Office. “Business owners get the information they need to help respond better to consumer needs, and it is a great help to government officials planning public services."
			</p>
			<p>
			Before the CE interviews begin, households will receive a letter from Census Bureau Director Louis Kincannon informing them of their selection. Census Bureau field representatives conducting the interviews carry official photo identification. The law ensures survey respondents’ answers are kept confidential.
			</p>
			<p>
			The following data on the amount spent on housing are an example of CE results:
